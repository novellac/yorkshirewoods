location: Yorkshire Woods neighborhood!
description: Neighborhood volunteers gathered to plant trees near select homes.
  We worked up a sweat, but the result will be worth it! The trees will be cared
  for by an external organization for the first couple years. We look forward to
  the beneficial ecological effects, as well as the beauty and the summer shade!

      in the autumn sun. One person holds a shovel, and a few have their shoes
      covered so they can work in dirt.

    alt: Five people with shovels dig holes in grass near the sidewalk. One young
      tree wrapped in canvas waits tipped over nearby, and another has recently
      been planted in a hole. Two of the people wear blue shirts which read,
      "Volunteer."

## Get started developing locally!

1. If you are confident that you will use this code under the terms of its license, then [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on Github.
2. Clone or download the repo to your computer.
3. Open a bash terminal and move to the root folder of the repository.
4. In the bash terminal, install the dependencies by running `yarn` in the root folder of the repository.
5. In the bash terminal, run `yarn dev` and copy the local address that appears in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000/`).
6. In a web browser, paste the address you just copied into the address bar and hit enter.

You should now be able to make changes to the code and see the output in your web browser.
